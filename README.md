# CovidTracker

CovidTracker is a CLI application which provides users a direct view into daily state-by-state Covid data. 
Additional US Territory information also accessible. Upon running, simply select via prompt the state or territory for which you'd like to view. Upon viewing, users can then elect to view "Metadata" (local testing protocols, standards, etc.). 

**Note:**
Data is retrieved via the COVID Tracking Project API: [https://covidtracking.com](https://covidtracking.com)
